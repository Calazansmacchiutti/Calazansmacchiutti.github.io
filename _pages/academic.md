# Academic Profile

## Research Focus

During my doctoral program, I focused my studies on the **physical properties of transition metal oxides**, with a special emphasis on the investigation of **double perovskite-type structures** and their impact on the **"exchange bias" phenomenon**.

My research covers a variety of techniques, including:
- Magnetic measurements
- Electrical and thermal transport studies
- X-ray diffraction
- Magnetoresistance analysis
- Investigation of strong electronic correlation phenomena

## Materials Synthesis Experience

I have extensive experience in materials synthesis through various methods:
- **Sol-gel** synthesis
- **Co-precipitation** methods
- **Solid-state** synthesis
- **Floating zone** techniques

All syntheses included both **polycrystals and single crystals** of:
- Ternary and quaternary rare earth oxides
- Binary single crystals such as V₂O₅

## Research Collaboration

Before my doctoral studies, I actively participated in projects at the **Brazilian Center for Physics Research**, where I gained experience in various characterization techniques:
- **X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)**
- **Raman spectroscopy**
- **Atomic force microscopy (AFM)** for characterization of metal oxides

## Early Research Experience

In my undergraduate studies, I worked with:
- **Musical Acoustics** and **Environmental Acoustics**
- Applications of electromagnetic waves in magnetic resonance of ceramic materials
- Analysis of sound waves in music
