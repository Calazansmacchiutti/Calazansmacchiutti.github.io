# Data Science Profile

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;">Transforming data into solutions for your business.</p>

My journey is marked by the development and application of **statistical models**, focusing on identifying patterns, trends, and generating relevant insights. I work with both **descriptive and predictive modeling**, always aiming to translate complex results into clear, objective, and accessible materials for all audiences.

## Technical Skills

### Programming & Data Manipulation
- **Python** is my main language for data manipulation, using libraries such as **Pandas**, **Polars**, and **NumPy**
- **SQL** for data querying and management
- Experience with **Dask** and **PySpark** for handling large volumes of data efficiently

### Data Visualization & Analysis
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for data visualization
- Statistical analysis with **SciPy** and **Statsmodels**

### Machine Learning & AI
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, and **XGBoost** for building and training models
- **Prophet** and **Darts** for time series manipulation and forecasting

### Cloud & DevOps
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment of data solutions
- Experience creating and managing instances on **GCP** (Google Cloud Platform) and **Azure**
