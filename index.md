Welcome to my academic website! I am **Calazans Macchiutti**, a researcher and data scientist with a Ph.D. in Physics from CBPF (Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas).

My research spans from fundamental physics to applied data science. I specialize in the physical properties of transition metal oxides, with particular focus on double perovskite structures and exchange bias phenomena. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at ESPM, applying machine learning and AI to educational data.

## Research Interests

- **Condensed Matter Physics**: Exchange bias, double perovskites, magnetic materials
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling, time series analysis, deep learning
- **Materials Science**: Synthesis and characterization of single crystals and polycrystals
- **Applied AI**: Educational analytics, process optimization, business intelligence

## Professional Experience

- **Data Scientist** at ESPM - Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (2024-Present)
- **Senior Data Scientist** at BINAHKI (2023-2024)
- **Doctoral Research** at CBPF - Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas (2020-2024)

My work bridges the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, transforming complex data into actionable insights for both academic and industrial contexts.
